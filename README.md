# About this Project
This is a demo website for Urinalytics HealthCare Pvt. Ltd. Any copying of the website without the permission
of the developer is a punishable offence.
This website was developed as an internship project by the developer at IIT Kanpur, Kanpur, India.
# Features
This website acts as a user information portal that helps manage the user's personal information and
sensor's data to a user friendly dashboard. 
The user management system deployed lets the user see all his personal health records and review their
health. The sensor data is encrypted and served separately to the database.
This server can only access the data records of a person. This website contains the backend server and the dynamic html pages. 
# How it Works?
Urinalytics Healthcare Pvt. Ltd. is a healthcare firm dealing with the proactive detection of chronic kindney disease
by analyzing the urine samples of its users. The hardware sensors to analyze the urine samples are deployed in public restrooms. 
1. When a user pees in a Urinalytics enabled urinal, the sensor immediately detects the vital information from the urine sample. 
2. Once the user is finished, a unique QR Code is generated and displayed to the user via the oled screen deployed at the top of the urinal.  
3. Users scan the QR Code and a login screen is prompted.
4. After a successful login all the previous and new medical records are shown to the user.
